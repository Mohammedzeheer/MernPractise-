WAF

`What is WAF?`
A Web Application Firewall (WAF) is a security tool that protects web applications from various types of cyberattacks and vulnerabilities.

`What does WAF do?`
WAF filters and monitors web traffic, blocking malicious requests and preventing common web application attacks.

`Key Functions of WAF:`
Rule-based filtering, signature-based detection, behavioral analysis, blocking bad IPs, virtual patching, logging/reporting, SSL/TLS handling, compliance support.

`Why use a WAF?`
To add an extra layer of defense against web-based attacks and protect sensitive information in web applications.
Common Web Attacks Prevented by WAF:

SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), cross-site request forgery (CSRF), etc.

`Benefits of WAF:`
Enhances web application security, helps in compliance, provides logging and reporting for monitoring, and offers protection against known and emerging threats.

NGINX is a high-performance open-source web server and proxy server software known for its efficiency in handling concurrent connections and low resource usage. It's widely used to serve web content and also works as a reverse proxy, load balancer, and HTTP cache.

Reverse proxy server

A reverse proxy server is a type of proxy server that sits in front of one or more web servers. It intercepts requests from clients and forwards them to the appropriate web server.

The reverse proxy server can perform a variety of tasks, such as:

Load balancing: The reverse proxy server can distribute traffic across multiple web servers to improve performance.
Caching: The reverse proxy server can cache frequently accessed content to improve performance.
SSL termination: The reverse proxy server can terminate SSL connections on behalf of the web servers, which can improve security.
Security filtering: The reverse proxy server can filter traffic and block malicious requests.

Proxy server

A proxy server is a server that acts as an intermediary between a client and another server. It can be used to improve performance, security, and anonymity.

When a client sends a request to a proxy server, the proxy server forwards the request to the destination server. The proxy server then receives the response from the destination server and forwards it back to the client.

DOS AND DDOS 

A `denial-of-service (DoS)` attack is a type of cyber attack in which the perpetrator seeks to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users by temporarily or indefinitely disrupting services of a host connected to a network. This is typically done by overwhelming the target with traffic, or by exploiting a vulnerability in the target system or network.

A `distributed denial-of-service (DDoS)` attack is a type of DoS attack that originates from multiple distributed sources. This makes DDoS attacks much more difficult to defend against, as the attacker can overwhelm the target with traffic from many different locations.

DoS and DDoS attacks can be used to target a wide range of system
